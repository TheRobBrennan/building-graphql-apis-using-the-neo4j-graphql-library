# The Neo4j GraphQL Library

## Lesson Overview

We will spend the rest of the course building a GraphQL API for an online bookstore using the Neo4j GraphQL Library. In this lesson, we set up our online development environment using Codesandbox and Neo4j Sandbox. We then see how to use GraphQL type definitions to define a property graph data model in Neo4j and create a GraphQL API using the Neo4j GraphQL Library. Weâ€™ll create data using GraphQL mutations and see how to query it using GraphQL.
